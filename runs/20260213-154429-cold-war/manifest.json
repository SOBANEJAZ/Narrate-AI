The Cold War\u2019s battles ended, but its echoes linger: the internet, born from a defense network; the lingering nuclear stockpiles that still shape global politics; cultural memories of espionage, of fear, and of the relentless quest for progress. As we look back, the grave lessons of that era remind us that rivalry can be both a catalyst for innovation and a shadow that looms over every generation. The story of the Cold War is not merely a chronicle of weapons and treaties; it is a testament to humanity\u2019s capacity to stand at the edge of annihilation and still choose dialogue over devastation.",
