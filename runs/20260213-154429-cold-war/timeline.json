In the ash of Europe, two giants rose from the rubble: the United States, buoyed by industry and a promise of liberty, and the Soviet Union, hardened by sacrifice and driven by a vision of a workers\u2019 paradise. Their alliance, forged in the crucible of defeat, began to crumble as each claimed the right to shape the new order. Berlin, once a symbol of unity, split into silent sectors, and the globe felt the first tremor of a rivalry that would stretch for nearly half a century.",
