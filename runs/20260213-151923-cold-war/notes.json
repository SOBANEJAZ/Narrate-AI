    "text": "of contents After World War II drew to a close in the mid-20th century, a new conflict began. Known as the Cold War, this battle pitted the world\u2019s two great powers\u2014the democratic, capitalist United States and the communist Soviet Union\u2014against each other. Beginning in the late 1950s, space became another dramatic arena for this competition, as each side sought to prove the superiority of its technology, its military firepower and\u2013by extension\u2013its political and economic system. Causes of the Space Race By the mid-1950s, the U.S.-Soviet Cold War had worked its way into the fabric of everyday life in both countries, fueled by the arms race and the growing threat of nuclear weapons, wide-ranging espionage and counterespionage between the two countries, war in Korea and a clash of words and ideas carried out in the media. These tensions would continue throughout the space race, exacerbated by such events as the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 and the outbreak of war in Southeast Asia."
