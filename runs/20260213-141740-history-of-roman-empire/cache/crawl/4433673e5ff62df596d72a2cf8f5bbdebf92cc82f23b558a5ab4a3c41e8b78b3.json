Key events associated with Roman emperors are also a natural part of such a timeline, and the additions to this timeline mainly come from the book \u201c The Twelve Caesars ,\u201d written by the imperial biographer Suetonius. The purpose of this timeline is to provide an overview and a comprehensive understanding of Roman history to serve as a framework for organizing knowledge. By knowing, for example, when Julius Caesar lived and what he did, one can draw parallels, such as the fact that Emperor Augustus was his adopted son who took over after his death, and that the slave uprising led by Spartacus occurred during his lifetime. This timeline of the Roman Empire spans over 1,000 years, from 753 BC to AD 476, and will necessarily omit many details. Please feel free to reach out if there appear to be any significant omissions.

Roman Empire Timeline: The Roman Republic As the Roman Kingdom comes to an end, a new period called the Roman Republic begins.
