    "text": "Roman Architecture Table of contents Beginning in the eighth century B.C., Ancient Rome grew from a small town on central Italy\u2019s Tiber River into an empire that at its peak encompassed most of continental Europe, Britain, much of western Asia, northern Africa and the Mediterranean islands. Among the many legacies of Roman dominance are the widespread use of the Romance languages (Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian) derived from Latin, the modern Western alphabet and calendar and the emergence of Christianity as a major world religion. After 450 years as a republic, Rome became an empire in the wake of Julius Caesar\u2019s rise and fall in the first century B.C. The long and triumphant reign of its first emperor, Augustus, began a golden age of peace and prosperity; by contrast, the Roman Empire\u2019s decline and fall by the fifth century A.D. was one of the most dramatic implosions in the history of human civilization.

Key events associated with Roman emperors are also a natural part of such a timeline, and the additions to this timeline mainly come from the book \u201c The Twelve Caesars ,\u201d written by the imperial biographer Suetonius. The purpose of this timeline is to provide an overview and a comprehensive understanding of Roman history to serve as a framework for organizing knowledge. By knowing, for example, when Julius Caesar lived and what he did, one can draw parallels, such as the fact that Emperor Augustus was his adopted son who took over after his death, and that the slave uprising led by Spartacus occurred during his lifetime. This timeline of the Roman Empire spans over 1,000 years, from 753 BC to AD 476, and will necessarily omit many details. Please feel free to reach out if there appear to be any significant omissions.
